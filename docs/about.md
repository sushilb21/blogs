# About Me

Hey! I’m Sushil. I’m passionate about all things software and tech, always curious to learn and share new ideas. This blog is my little space to talk about coding, architecture, and anything tech-related that I find interesting.

I like to keep things practical and easy to understand, so whether you’re just starting out or have been in the game for a while, I hope you’ll find something useful here.

When I’m not exploring tech, you might catch me trying out new gadgets, picking up new skills, or just kicking back with a good book.

Thanks for stopping by — hope you enjoy the posts!
